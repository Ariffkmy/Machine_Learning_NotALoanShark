Python Technical Assessment (AI/ML Project)

You are a Python developer whose strength lies in data analytics and AI/ML modelling. The company you’re working for, NotALoanShark Sdn. Bhd., provides loans and would like to see how they can leverage on AI/ML models to predict which of their existing borrowers will fail repayment. This is so that they may take preventative measures to ensure the company’s capital is well-funded.
Your manager has provided you with a sample set of historical data of existing borrowers, their features/characteristics and whether they’ve failed to repay their loan. You have been tasked to train an AI/ML model that will be able to predict/classify whether existing borrowers will fail to repay their loan. To do so, you are expected to:
1. Study and analyze the condition of the given dataset with the use of simple statistics.
2. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (“EDA”) on the given dataset to understand the relationships between the given features and/or target variable.
3. Where deemed necessary, perform the appropriate data preprocessing and/or feature engineering.
4. Fit and train a suitable AI/ML model(s) and assess its performance using relevant metrics.
5. Determine the key metrics to be presented to the relevant stakeholders to showcase the model’s performance.
6. Document the entire development process and key findings in a clear and concise manner.

Your manager has left you a few points to consider:

1. The data is not necessarily clean and not all columns may be relevant. Hence, you may choose to alter the data as you deem fit.
2. The target variable column is called “repay_fail”.
3. You may split the given dataset into your training and testing dataset as deemed appropriate.
4. If multiple models were trained, measure each of their performance and decide on one final model.
5. The stakeholders may not possess the same level of technical knowledge as you do.
6. Your documentation should contain:
a. A clear step-by-step guide on the steps taken throughout the development process, including the assumptions made.
b. For any data alteration/preprocessing/sampling and/or feature engineering conducted, explain the rationale and objective behind it.
c. Include any visualization(s) and/or statistic(s) produced throughout and explain its importance/relevance.
d. The model(s) considered and your justification(s).
e. The model training process, output summary and the model(s) performance(s).
f. Concise explanation on the metric(s) used to measure the model(s) performance and why the metric(s) is deemed suitable.
g. If multiple models were trained, explain the final model selection process clearly.
h. A conclusive note on the final model selected and some key metric(s) to be presented relevant stakeholders to describe the model’s performance.
i. Any possible limitations of the final model and future enhancements to consider.

Please set up a new repo in GitHub and ensure the project is structured in a way that is easily reproducible for validation purposes. Kindly submit the GitHub link to us once completed.
Your documentation can be part of GitHub’s README.md or may be a separate Word document. You are recommended to use Python 3 and/or above.
Your manager wishes you the best of luck!
